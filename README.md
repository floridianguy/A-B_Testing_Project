This project was created as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program.  It analyzes a data set for consumer purchases in order to test whether or not a new web page results in higher conversion rates.  The analysis makes use of the pandas and statsmodels libraries in Python.

Examples from the statsmodels website were useful.
